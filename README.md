## Usage

Add files, series (folders), and streams (URLs) to your watchlist via the [Universal Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/universal-actions/).

Search through and play items from your list via the Play Keyword (default: `wlp`).

* <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd> Open the item‚Äôs URL in a web browser.
* <kbd>‚å•</kbd><kbd>‚èé</kbd>:
    * series: Rescan folder for audiovisual files.
    * stream: Download. Requires [Download Media](https://alfred.app/workflows/vitor/download-media/).

Try the Sort and Play Keyword (default: `wls`) to get different views of your list. Sorting is temporary and does not affect the main list‚Äôs order.

Manually edit the list via the Edit Keyword (default: `wle`). Your text editor will open for you to reorder and rename at will. Keep the initial six characters and colon together with your title. Save and quit your editor to apply the changes.

### Subtitle reference:

There are three types of item: file, series, and stream. Each result has its name as the title. The subtitle details information following a template:

```

```

    * stream: Always present.
* `(4)`: Number of elements.
    * file: N/A.
    * series: Remaining audiovisual files in folder.
    * stream: N/A for single items. Count of all items for playlists.
* `22m 32s`: Running time.
    * file: Running time of file.
    * series: Running time of first audiovisual file in folder.
    * stream: Combined running time of all elements.
* `691M`: Size.

    * series: Size of first audiovisual file in folder.

    * file: Path to file.

## Supported Players

All media players are supported, but not all are able to play streams. [mpv](http://mpv.io/), [IINA](https://lhc70000.github.io/iina/), and [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) are directly supported. With those, an item is not marked as watched if playback exits with a non-zero code. Take advantage of that to, for example, control when an item is marked as item and trashed. Disable the trashing behaviour entirely in the [Workflow‚Äôs Configuration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-configuration/).
