```

    * series: N/A.
    * stream: Always present.
* `(4)`: Number of elements.
    * file: N/A.
    * series: Remaining audiovisual files in folder.
    * stream: N/A for single items. Count of all items for playlists.
* `22m 32s`: Running time.
    * file: Running time of file.
    * series: Running time of first audiovisual file in folder.
    * stream: Combined running time of all elements.
* `691M`: Size.
    * file: Size of file.
    * series: Size of first audiovisual file in folder.
    * stream: N/A.
* `/Some/Path`: Path.
    * file: Path to file.
    * series: Path to folder.
    * stream: URL.

## Supported Players

All media players are supported, but not all are able to play streams. [mpv](http://mpv.io/), [IINA](https://iina.io/), and [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) are directly supported. With those, an item is not marked as watched if playback exits with a non-zero code. Take advantage of that to, for example, control when an item is marked as played and trashed. Disable the trashing behaviour entirely in the [Workflow’s Configuration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-configuration/).
